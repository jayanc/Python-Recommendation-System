As no training or optimization is involved, these are easy to use approaches. But their performance decrease when we have sparse data which hinders scalability of these approaches for most of the real-world problems.\n",

In matrix factorizaion, we decompose our original sparse matrix into product of 2 low rank orthogonal matrices. For deep learning implementation, we don’t need them to be orthogonal, we want our model to learn the values of embedding matrix itself. The user latent features and movie latent features are looked up from the embedding matrices for specific movie-user combination. These are the input values for further linear and non-linear layers. We can pass this input to multiple relu, linear or sigmoid layers and learn the corresponding weights by any optimization algorithm (Adam, SGD, etc.).\n",

This model performed better than all the approaches I attempted before (content-based, user-item similarity collaborative filtering, SVD). I can certainly improve this model's performance by making it deeper with more linear and non-linear layers. I leave that task to you then!"
